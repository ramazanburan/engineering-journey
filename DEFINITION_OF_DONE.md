# Definition of Done (DoD)

A work item is "done" only if:
- Code builds locally.
- Automated tests exist and pass.
- Edge-cases are considered (documented in commit/PR notes or journal).
- Logging is present for critical paths (when applicable).
- No secrets are committed; configuration uses safe defaults.
- A short explanation exists: what it does, assumptions, how verified.
